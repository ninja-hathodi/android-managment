        <h4>The Android OS is a Linux-based mobile operating system that runs primarily on smartphones and tablets.
          The Android platform includes the Android operating system (OS) and Its Linux kernel-based operating systems
          as well as end-user applications that can be downloaded.
          <br>

          The Android Automotive OS is built directly into the car, just to be an app that connects to the smartphone
          via Android Auto. This means that you do not need an Android-based phone for this usage; the operating
          system can be written in Java, which is shown in initial demonstrations of Android, relatively easily on
          inexpensive mobile phones with conventional number keys.
          <br>

          <h4>we all know about Android devices and we use , but at certain age devices are slow down and some
            times
            it stucks ,This happens with every device If you're Android user you need to know how to use in proper way
            to
            manage and increase system performance , efficiency following tips can helpful for you to make your device
            faster .. </h4><br>

    OS tends to garner rave reviews from those who prefer the operating system and its ease, but many users of
    IOS and Windows Phone argue that they can do just as much. Android is more popular today than Windows
    phones, and Google is on to something as it rolls out to mobile devices around the world. The new system
    provides a global developer community that has developed a wide range of apps for Android, as well as
    Windows Phone, iOS and Android.
    <br>

    This is true in every way, and here are 10 unique features for the Android OS, along with some of the key
    differences between it and other operating systems.
    <br>

    Most Android devices support NFC, which allows you to easily interact with electronic devices such as a
    phone, tablet, or even a tablet with a smartphone over short distances.
    <br>

    The operating system was originally developed for black and white phones that started with the latest
    smartphones and minicomputers and have become one of the most popular mobile operating systems in the world.
    Android is designed for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and tablets with NFC (Near Field
    Communication) and is a Linux-based operating system.

    <br>
    Android is the software that was founded in 2003 in Palo Alto, California by Google Inc., the parent company
    of Google, the world's most popular mobile operating system.

    <br>
    Last but not least, the Android Market, the Android equivalent of Apple's App Store, is home to millions of
    apps, many of which are completely free. Microsoft has released a vastly revised version of its software,
    which falls under Android. It has been redesigned and rebuilt from scratch, with a greater emphasis on the
    user experience, and the result is an operating system called Windows Phone.

        <h1><strong>battery management</strong></h1><br>
        <h4>You can work with your phone's settings, including Internet connection, screen brightness and timeouts, to
          optimize setup according to your battery back up needs.

          Battery Optimizer Cleaner from Intel is a great battery-saving app for Android that lets you easily monitor
          your mobile data usage, clean your memory and increase your mobile battery life for Android. The best features
          include battery management, battery fuse, energy management and more.

          Kaspersky Battery Life is an app that not only saves your phone's battery but also increases it by monitoring

          life as possible without compromising its performance. Give us an active warning to keep you informed of the
          latest news, updates, security updates and other important information about your Android device.

          The app consists of an "App Sucker" option that closes all apps that discharge your battery, and before you

    If you have unnecessary apps running in the background, you will discharge your battery faster than usual. Increase
    battery life by blocking apps that run in the background and make sure you don't have to run them.
    <br>
    If like me, you need a phone all the time and need to keep the battery longer, then you should try the battery app
    Dfndr, which saves your battery through a battery management app like the Battery Manager on your phone. If you are
    in a situation where there is a constant need for your phone and you need to keep the batteries long, this app will
    work for you.
    <br>
    The Battery Management App Dfndr works in the same way as the Battery Manager on your phone but is a little more
    advanced.
    <br>
    Battery protectors help you optimize your phone by showing the full picture of your battery consumption. The Android
    app Kaspersky Battery Life switches the phone to more conservative use and gives tips for remaining life and habit -
    and improves tips.
    <br>
    Adjust your phone to brighten or lengthen time - for example, when using news apps or social media, or for long
    periods.
    <br>
    The AccuBattery app allows you to monitor how much battery your phone uses And what else you can find in the
    settings of the app. The cool thing about this app is how you use it, you don't even have to turn the phone around
    to turn on the savings mode. You can even turn off all the functions of your phone to instantly save more battery.

    <br>
    It is also a good idea to charge the battery 100% and let it discharge completely at any time to make it last
    longer. Android has a battery conservation mode that automatically adjusts the charging speed, battery usage and
    other parameters that drain the battery. It tells you that you can use your device and do not have to be permanently
    attached to the charging station.
    <br>
    If you understand what is causing battery drain and how to identify and mitigate the biggest causes, you will see
    major improvements. It can be difficult to find apps that save your battery, as most battery-saving measures are
    manual, including turning off screen brightness, turning off app sync frequency, and other proven - and - true
    methods. First, Battery Saver tries to reduce the brightness and stop background processes that are running in the
    background and are not being used.
    <br>
    If you want to try an app that could help you, here are some of the best battery saver apps for Android, along with
    some tips and tricks, and a list of some other great battery management tools.
    <br>

          Fortunately, a careful approach to memory management can help you create space without losing the content
          that is important to you. When it comes to memory management, the best starting point is in the settings of
          your smartphone. You can check exactly how much memory you are using and what you have found in the phone's
          memory menu.<br> <br>
          By navigating to the Settings app on your Android device and clicking on the Storage option, you can get a
          look at your storage. You can also freely explore how space is used, which should make it easier for you to
          find areas where improvements can be made, whether you back up photos or just delete a few apps. Here are
          some tips on how to stop apps from wasting precious space on an Android phone, making room for new apps,
          photos, and other content, and even adding more storage to the device. <br> <br>
          Above you can see how much of your phone's total memory was used, followed by the various categories that
          take up space on your phones, such as photos, videos, music and music. <br>
          <br>
          Photos and videos occupy the largest space, followed by music and audio, and these have to do with file
          management. When you free up space on your Android device, your phone has several functions it calls
          "storage," and these functions are performed by you. These functions can be performed in different ways,
          such as file storage, file sharing, or file access control.<br> <br>
          A file manager app can help you clean your phone easily and create more storage space. It can scan your
          device to remove duplicate files, identify unused apps that use up the space needed, and clean up your
          contact list. This Google + file management app easily scans all your devices and gives you the ability to
          share the space of your phone with just a few taps.

      Closing a running app manually helps with battery life, but Apple and Google have recently debunked that
      myth. Your phone's system requires you to run the app when you reopen it, and manually close it to help your
      battery life. Tap an app, press "Uninstall" to remove all the data generated by that app, and "Close" after
      you close it.

      Many Android apps, including Google Maps, Gmail, Google Play Store and many others, feature widgets that are
      conveniently located on your home screen for real-time updates. The Recents Screen app is a collection of
      all the activities and tasks you have recently accessed, as well as the current state of the app.

      Android N's recent app key has grown into a bunch of awesome new ones, but how do you use the recent apps
      feature in Android Pie to overview your apps by tapping the Home button and then swiping up? Your phone is
      an integral part of the operating system, so you can see a deck of cards of all your recently used apps.

      Android Launcher is the part of its interface that lets you launch apps, customize your home screen, receive
      calls, and perform other tasks. On Samsung Galaxy phones, the latest-generation screen is usually referred
      to as the overview screen in the Android operating system.

      If the current apps button doesn't work on your Android phone, chances are that an update may have caused a
      problem with the default launcher. In this case, you can switch to an alternative Android launcher that not
      only helps you solve the problem, but also offers other features, such as the ability to customize the app
      drawer and create custom shortcuts.

      If your Android 11 phone is facing the problem that the newer apps of Android don't work, this quirky bug
      may have started to sneak up on you.



      On Android 10, you'll see a list of all the apps you've just opened, as well as an overview of what's going
      on in each app. On Android 11, what you see at the bottom of the screen is a single flat line, and it has
      recently opened all of your ongoing apps. Confirm that when you restart your phone, the current app function
      will be maintained at work until you open the overview screen on Android 11. How to optimize the

      A hardware or factory data reset prevents the new user of the smartphone from accessing personal information
      and sets the phone as if it were brand new. In such a situation, it is best to first consider backing up
      your data online to allow easy access to your next device. A hard reset can be performed to back up data and
      remove all personal data such as photos, videos, contacts and other data from your smartphone before you
      remove it yourself.
      <br>
      Android Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is one of the most important advantages of a hard reset or factory
      data reset for Android smartphones. There are several options to perform hard resets and factory data resets
      for your Android smartphone. ,
      <br>
      Factory Reset is in some cases only available to you and other people using your phone, and others perform a
      factory reset without your permission.
      <br>
      This policy is designed to understand how we collect, communicate, disclose and use your personal
      information. How we use and disclose your private information, such as your name, address, telephone number,
      email address and telephone number, and how you use it.
      <br>
      This way, if your terminal is stolen, you may not use its access to your personal information in the way
      that you would not if it were stolen. Google has introduced a factory reset process that is considered
      insecure, so if a thief wants to perform a factory reset, his phone can block access completely. The process
      is very simple and fast, and your device has the advantage of being new or not.
      <br>
      Nowadays, it is very unlikely that you have not heard about the factory reset of Android devices. We have
      several articles that relate to this process that will bring performance improvements to your device and how
      to do it on different phones. So this article will tell you that there are ways to reset your Android phone
      to factory settings, what the benefits are of resetting the device completely, how it does that, and much
      more. At the end of the article, there is an explanation about the benefits of factory resets of Android
      phones, as well as the way they work.
      <br>
      An Android Factory Reset is a complete reset of your Android device that erases everything that has been
      installed so far, such as all applications, photos and videos that have been taken. Performing a factory
      data reset helps to completely erase everything on the device and reset all settings and data to their
      default values.
      <br>
      While performing a factory reset can help solve a few other problems you may also experience, it is also
      meant to help make your device faster. This helps the device to function better when loaded with all apps
      and software that may have been installed over some time. Encrypt your Android system by going to Settings -
      Security - Encrypted on your devices and find the Reset option. ,
      <br>
      It is also possible to find apps in the Google Play Store that promise to overwrite parts of the operating
      system that have been marked as free but can still contain the original data. The way to format the memory
      is to access the recovery mode of the device, but the results of both methods are the same.
      <br>
      For example, if you do not have access to the settings of your smartphone, forget your password or unlock
      the pattern, or press the reset button for a long time, which is placed in the case of the phone, the device
      will be reset. The user must perform a factory

      Smartphones and tablets make up for this by using significantly less battery, RAM and memory for the type of
      apps you use. In the Play Store, you can find a lot of options to improve and create your device, but you
      have to go to the developer option. If you want to do this and have an even better gaming experience, you
      will want to disable the Background service option. Depending on the device, you will be looking for RAM
      usage during the ongoing service process.

      The Boost app has a great feature to make this change temporarily, so when you finish a game, the settings

      So let's see if PUBG Mobile plays lags on your Android device, and if so, you'll need to follow these
      optimization tips to get a delay-free PUG Mobile experience on a slow Android device. If you are playing
      PUBG Mobile on an Android device with over 2GB of RAM, you can play it at a much faster speed.
      <br>
      So to solve the problem of game delay, you need to clear the cache on your phone and go into recovery mode.
      PUBG Mobile will lag on your phone when its cache overloads your device, so just delete it. To fix this, you
      must first clear all the caches on your phone by simply deleting them.
      <br>
      Your device has the option to switch to restore mode, but that doesn't work in all cases. To see how you do
      it and see if it works for you.
      <br>
      Turning off the battery saver will give your gaming performance a little boost while playing PUBG on your
      phone. You can disable it by going to your phone's settings and disabling it in the Settings tab.
      <br>
      This removes unwanted files such as audio and video from the internal memory, which will boost the game. And
      it will cause a slowdown in your phone's performance during the game.
      <br>
      There is an option in the game that allows you to clear the cache of your game, but it would be best if you
      do this regularly to free up additional space in your phone and prevent it from slowing down and fix the
      delay in Mobile Legends. Clearing the in-game cache removes delays in mobile legends, improves game
      performance, frees up disk space, and frees up disk space.
      <br>
      This includes prioritizing the performance of the game at the expense of reducing graphics quality, as well
      as the performance of the game itself, as in the case of Mobile Legends.
      <br>
      The latest version of Android is critical to speed and perhaps the fastest solution to this problem. To
      speed up your slow Android phone, check for updates: Open the Settings app on your Android phone, and then
      tap Software Updates. Sometimes Android updates improve performance and solve problems that could lead to
      performance degradation.
      <br>
      This is especially true if you're trying to eat up a bit more life from an older Android device, but there
      are several options available that you can check out the Settings app on your Android phone.
      <br>
      If you want to play PUBG Mobile without delay, you need to optimize your Android settings, and we'll show
      you how to enable Hidden Developer Options on Android and use them to enhance your PUBG Mobile gaming
      experience on Android. If you don't care about Android, then you won't be able to play PUPG mobile without
      delay. The root cause of this is bebe the Android device because if you don't take care of it you won't be
      able to play PUBG mobile without delay in the future.
      <br>
      With these recommendations, you can turn off the PUBG app and enjoy playing it without delay, or turn it on
      and play without delay.
      <br>
      To make PUBG run smoothly on Android, select this option and disable battery optimization. Choose "PUBG
      Mobile" and it will prove to be a responsible battery saver but at the expense of performance.
      <br>
      If you don't close one of these apps before turning it off, stay in the same state, slow down your phone and
      zap your battery life.
      <br>
      You can see which apps take up the most space on your iPhone by tapping Manage Settings, Storage and
      Storage. To find and close an app, double-click the Home button and then swipe to the right of the app. You
      don't use it to close it. You can also take up more space by backing up photos and videos to a cloud
      computer or deleting them from your phone.
      <br>
      Saving to your phone is now easier, as you have the latest operating system called Oreo, which has had its
      first major update in recent months.

        <h4>If you're playing game like pubg ,call of duty then use GFX tools and decrease resolution to VGA level
          640×480 (VGA) .
          And set FPS according to your device capabilities this setting are useful for less hardware phones ie.
          1-2
          GB
          RAM devices.</h4><br>
        <p><strong></strong>The most common thing in android device is heating , it makes device slower and may
          lag ,
          to
          fix this problem , we can purchase online additional fans for cooling and always play game without
          backcover
          that's helpful in cooling faster . If your device is less internal RAM and ROM.
          Always keep graphics low and put minimum resolution, that decreases game quality but games can be played
          very
          smoothly . <br> <br>

      Smartphones and tablets make them use significantly less battery, RAM and memory for the type of apps they
      use. In the Play Store you can find a lot of options to improve and enhance your device, but to do that you
      have to go to the developer option. Depending on the device, we can search the running services and
      processes to find out how much RAM is used. If you want to have an even better gaming experience, you might
      want to disable the background service option, but if you don't, you'll need to disable it.
      The free GFX tool allows you to optimize otherwise hidden graphics settings to improve performance. The
      Boost app has a great feature to make temporary changes so that settings revert to their original state when
      you stop playing a game. <br> <br>
      If you have a Samsung phone, you can use the Game Launcher app, which is included with the Samsung Galaxy S6
      and S7 Edge as well as other Samsung devices. <br> <br>
      You can log in to your favourite games, and when you play, you will be logged into Notifications. Most
      mobile devices are not built-in - in memory for games you play, so there's usually no way to optimize your
      phone's performance with the Game Launcher app on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S7 Edge.
      By using the optimization techniques in this guide, you can drastically reduce your storage requirements by
      setting up your games properly. You will experience a significant performance improvement on a wide range of
      devices, including new and old ones. <br> <br>
      With the optimization techniques described in this guide, Disrupted Logic and Dead Corps 2 can run on old
      low-power Android tablets, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and HTC One M9.
      While developers only have to deal with a very limited number of hardware goals, releasing games for Android
      requires optimization for different performance levels, especially if iOS comes along. Now, a new library in
      the Android Game SDK will help developers improve the performance of their games on Android phones in a much
      more streamlined way. In this blog post announced today, Android Performance Tuner gives game performance
      insights from Android Vitals. <br> <br>
      It optimizes Android by installing various games and performance-enhancing apps that are readily available
      in the Google Play Store. These apps can be installed on your device, which will help to improve the quality
      and graphics performance of the device. Many of these gaming boost applications have special features that
      are only in action while playing on a device and you can also change their settings manually.
      Depending on how you use your phone, you may notice a difference in the performance of on-the-go games and
      other apps you may use daily. <br> <br>
      The most notable difference maybe how long your battery lasts, but if you see an app that you don't use
      regularly, it means it runs in the background of your device, draining the battery faster than it should.
      Getting rid of unused, resource-intensive apps will go a long way to improving the performance of an Android
      phone. I have installed and disabled numerous apps, and there has been no noticeable improvement in
      performance. <br> <br>
      If you follow the above-mentioned suggestions, these tips and improvements will help you make your Android
      faster and smoother while using it. The more free storage the phone has to increase its battery performance,
      the more it needs to use, and the better. <br> <br>
      Android users are very interested in their apps, so check out these suggestions that every designer, blogger
      and photographer lover should try. <br> <br>
      Both paid and free game optimizers can significantly improve the performance of your device while playing.
      In - Less graphic details can be a problem, so to save time, prepare a Game Booster app for Android, iOS and
      Windows Phone 8.0. The best you need when it comes to game boosters for your Android app is to save you some
      time by preparing for the worst game performance on your Android phone or tablet.
      If there is something that is not optimized, the game speed will not look as great as it could and will
      stutter or even stutter. This letter will introduce you to the Game Optimizing Service for Android phones,
      which will make your Android device faster for gaming and increase your gaming performance. You can increase
      your game performance and play your favourite games without dropping frames by using popular games - Speed
      Booster Apps.
